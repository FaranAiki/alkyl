# Alkyl Programming Language

Alkyl is named after aikil (aiki language). 

A simple programming language written using LLVM-IR.

# Purpose 

Creating a programming language that can be automated using Artificial Intelligence. As the world grows, programming may not using languages like Python, C, Rust, Zig, or others. This is why this programming language exist: to make it easy for AI to understand, generate, and check.

Moreover, Alkyl used syntax similar to C "but lazy" so developer can understand had there been a bug that AI missed.

# Core Feature 

Core feature is the high-level and simplicity of C, combined with C++'s object oriented programming with is-a has-a feature.

Todo implemented:
* threading { }
* inert so that inert entities cannot be has-ed
* crazy docs
* crazy error handling
